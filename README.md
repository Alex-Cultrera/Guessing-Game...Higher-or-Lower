Project where I used Java to create a game application where the player gets 5 chances to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

The player is promted to pick a number from 1 to 100. If the user enters a number outside of that range, then an error message display giving the user feedback that their pick was invalid and allows them to pick again. An invalid pick does not affect the number of guesses the player has remaining. 

If the user enters a valid pick, they are then prompted to pick either a higher or lower number (depending on if they chose a number higher or lower than the randomly generated number).
